# MAT-ActionRPG
This project will be submitted as MAT2 for assessment
The main branch of this project contains the implementation of
# Inventory system
# Dialogue System
# Quest System
although the game is playable still it lacks in many things such as the code is repetative and managing enemy and surrounding was not easy at my current level.
